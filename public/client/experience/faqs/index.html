<p>[expand title=&#8221;What is China Horizons and what do you offer?&#8221; tag=&#8221;h3&#8243;]</p>
<blockquote><p>China Horizons matches teachers interested in having an authentic overseas experience with schools who are looking for conversational English teachers.  One great advantage to participating through China Horizons is that we have a volunteer program for teachers looking for an affordable volunteer opportunity, as well as a paid program for teachers with a bachelor&#8217;s degree.</p></blockquote>
<p>[/expand]</p>
<p>[expand title=&#8221;How does it work?&#8221; tag=&#8221;h3&#8243;]</p>
<blockquote><p>After a simple application process, your information is reviewed by China Horizons.  The quality of your experience depends on your spirit of optimism, sense of adventure, and creativity.</p></blockquote>
<p>[/expand]</p>
<p>[expand title=&#8221;Do you have a summer program?&#8221; tag=&#8221;h3&#8243;]</p>
<blockquote><p>Not at the current time.</p></blockquote>
<p>[/expand]</p>
<p>[expand title=&#8221;Who will be my employer while I am in China?&#8221; tag=&#8221;h3&#8243;]</p>
<blockquote><p>While in China, you will be working directly with your school through your school liaison.  China Horizons will not work closely with the day to day activities of you and your school.</p>
<p>China Horizons will be in constant contact with your school.  We offer complete support and help while teachers are in China.  Furthermore, we will be there to help resolve any issues that may arise between teachers and schools.</p></blockquote>

<p>[expand title=&#8221;Can I bring my laptop to China with me?  Is it safe or will I get viruses?&#8221; tag=&#8221;h3&#8243;]</p>
<blockquote><p>Yes.</p>
<p>Many teachers bring their laptops with them to China.  You should have current virus protection software installed. Standard virus protection software will be sufficient to protect your computer.</p>
<p>Most apartments will have internet connection through an ethernet cable.</p></blockquote>
<p>[/expand]</p>
<p>[expand title=&#8221;How long will I be in China for?&#8221; tag=&#8221;h3&#8243;]</p>
<blockquote><p>Spring Semester: February 21 – June 30</p>
<p>Fall Semester: September 1 – December 31</p>
<p>Be aware that you might need to be flexible as these dates may be subject to change.</p>
<p>These are the scheduled dates for teaching and do not include teacher training and the optional group arrival tour.</p></blockquote>
<p>[/expand]</p>
<p>[expand title=&#8221;How are placements decided?&#8221; tag=&#8221;h3&#8243;]</p>
<blockquote><p>If teachers have a preference as to where they want to teach, what age they teach, and friends they want to teach with, we will do our best to make these arrangements possible.</p>
<p>Other than that, China Horizons matches teachers up with schools that we feel most suits the individual teachers.</p></blockquote>

<p>[expand title=&#8221;Do I need to know how to speak Chinese?&#8221; tag=&#8221;h3&#8243;]</p>

<blockquote><p>You should pay the application deposit when you submit your application.</p>
<p>The deposit will be deducted from the total program fee. It is not an additional fee.</p>
<p>If you are not accepted as a teacher, you will receive 100% of all China Horizons fees paid up to that point.</p>

<p>[expand title=&#8221;Are there any additional expenses I need to plan for?&#8221; tag=&#8221;h3&#8243;]</p>
<blockquote><p>Teachers should be prepared to have access to sufficient money for extra activities they plan on doing such as traveling, eating out, buying clothing, and souvenirs.</p>
<p>Although these activities are significantly cheaper in China than in the U.S., money can add up fast. Preparing a budget would be wise.</p>
<p>China Horizons recommends bringing at least an additional $950 of personal spending money.  Depending on your spending habits, you should adjust this amount.</p></blockquote>
<p>[/expand]</p>
<p>[expand title=&#8221;Should I bring travelers checks, cash, or debit cards?&#8221; tag=&#8221;h3&#8243;]</p>
<blockquote><p>All cash should be in the form of <strong>new crisp bills from the bank</strong>.  Worn bills, in any form, are often not accepted.</p>
<p>Because travelers checks are becoming increasingly difficult to cash, China Horizons does not recommend bringing them.</p>
<p>Debit cards are a good backup plan. Since China is a “cash” country, you will be using cash most of the time.  Few places are set up to accept international debit or credit cards.  Do not rely on your debit card as your main way of making purchases.  Debit cards can be used to withdraw money from ATM machines, but be aware that every bank has different regulations and fees when it comes to international withdrawals.  Please contact your bank for more information.</p>
<p>If you intend to use your debit card in China, please contact your bank prior to departure and inform them you will be in China.  If you do not,  they might freeze your bank account as a safety precaution upon seeing transaction activity in China.</p>
<p>In order to avoid multiple international charges on your bank accounts China Horizons suggests exchanging USD to RMB with your bank before you leave for China. Do not exchange enough money for the duration of your stay, but just for the first few weeks. Once you are settled into your city you will be able to find an ATM that will accept your bank card.</p></blockquote>
<p>[/expand]</p>
<p>[expand title=&#8221;Can I use my ATM card in China&#8221; tag=&#8221;h3&#8243;]</p>
<blockquote><p>Yes.</p>
<p>ATM’s can be found in populated areas of China, and most will accept international ATM cards.</p>
<p>However, be aware that every bank has different regulations and fees regarding international withdrawals.  You should contact your bank for specific information.</p></blockquote>
<p>[/expand]</p>
<p>[expand title=&#8221;Are the costs different if you are married?&#8221; tag=&#8221;h3&#8243;]</p>

<p>[expand title=&#8221;Will I need to purchase a textbook when I get to China?&#8221; tag=&#8221;h3&#8243;]</p>

<p>If the school has a specific textbook they want you to use, they will provide it.</p></blockquote>

<p>[expand title=&#8221;Is it safe to carry cash around in China?&#8221; tag=&#8221;h3&#8243;]</p>
<blockquote><p>Yes, with precautions of course.</p>
<p>Most teachers carry cash in their pockets and never have any problems. However, there is always risk involved when carrying cash with you.  China is no exception.  Be careful with your money.</p>
<p>Don’t carry around more than you need; be discrete with how much you have with you, and put it in a safe place (like your front pockets).</p></blockquote>
<p>[/expand]</p>
<p>[expand title=&#8221;What is the best way to take money into China?&#8221; tag=&#8221;h3&#8243;]</p>
<blockquote><p> Bringing cash with you or withdrawing money once in China is fine.  It depends on your personal preference.</p>
<p>If you bring cash, do not put it all in one place.  Spread it out in your luggage and your wallet.  This way, if something happens and your luggage does not arrive at the airport with you, you will  still have cash.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>As long as you have a strong application and submit your application before the deadline, your chances are very high for acceptance.</p>
<p>Teaching positions available though China Horizons vary each semester.  We do not have a cap on the number of teachers we accept into the program.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>All applicants who submit their applications before the deadline will be equally considered.</p>
<p>If you have a specific request (i.e. to be placed with friends, etc.), applying early will be beneficial.  If you apply after the application deadline, your acceptance will be dependent on the amount of positions still available.</p></blockquote>
<p>[/expand]</p>
<p>[expand title=&#8221;If I am accepted, when do I have to commit to going?&#8221; tag=&#8221;h3&#8243;]</p>
<blockquote><p>Living in China is a fairly large commitment.  We encourage you to plan carefully before making this commitment.  This should not be a spontaneous decision, but one that is well thought out and carefully considered.</p>
<p>The final point of commitment will be when you submit your application and send in your application fee.  After that point, if you withdraw from the program, you will not receive a refund.</p>
<p>China Horizons is aware that uncontrollable circumstances occasionally occur and handles these situations on a case by case basis.</p></blockquote>
<p>[/expand]</p>
<p>[expand title=&#8221;If I am accepted, and you are not able to place me at a school, is the application fee refundable?&#8221; tag=&#8221;h3&#8243;]</p>
<blockquote><p>Yes.</p>
<p>If you are accepted into the program, but, for whatever reason, China Horizons is unable to arrange a placement for the semester indicated by the applicant, the fee is fully refundable.</p></blockquote>
<p>[/expand]</p>
<p>[expand title=&#8221;Do teachers for the fall semester get home in time for Christmas?&#8221; tag=&#8221;h3&#8243;]</p>
<blockquote><p>Fall teachers are contracted through December.  This means that you will most likely be in China during Christmas.</p>

<ul>
<li>Review the China Horizons website thoroughly.</li>
<li>Write down specific questions about teaching and living in China.</li>
<li>Prepare to talk about your desires for teaching and living in China.</li>
</ul>

<p>[/expand]</p>
<p>[expand title=&#8221;Is it important for me to know Chinese before I apply?&#8221; tag=&#8221;h3&#8243;]</p>
<blockquote><p>No.</p>
<p>Most teachers do not have any Chinese language training.  Less than 10% of the applicants speak any level of Chinese.</p>
<p>Because it is helpful to have knowledge of the language, China Horizons recommends that all teachers learn at least a few basic phrases.  This is, however, not factored into your acceptance.</p></blockquote>

<p>[expand title=&#8221;I am not a native English speaker, but I speak English fluently.  Can I still apply?&#8221; tag=&#8221;h3&#8243;]</p>
<blockquote><p>Yes.</p>
<p>You must be fluent in English in order to apply.  To be a successful teacher, you will need to have an easy to understand accent as well (American, British, Australian, etc.)</p></blockquote>
<p>[/expand]</p>
<p>[expand title=&#8221;I am not a resident of the United States, am I still eligible?&#8221; tag=&#8221;h3&#8243;]</p>

<p>[/expand]</p>
<p>[expand title=&#8221;Can I request to be placed near or in Beijing?&#8221; tag=&#8221;h3&#8243;]</p>
<blockquote><p>At this time, China Horizons does not place teachers in Beijing.</p>
<p>China is very connected through trains, planes, and buses.  This gives those who desire to go to Beijing the ability to do so, at least once during their time in China.  Teachers will usually visit Beijing during a holiday break or at the end of the semester.</p>
<p>Often times, an organized tour is planned upon arriving in China with China Horizons.  Not always, but occasionally, this optional tour is in Beijing.</p>
<p>There are plenty of opportunities to visit Beijing during your stay in China.  If you have desires to go there, and you make it one of your goals, you will most likely be able to achieve it.</p></blockquote>
<p>[/expand]</p>
<p>[expand title=&#8221;Can I request to be placed in a big or small city?&#8221; tag=&#8221;h3&#8243;]</p>
<blockquote><p>Yes.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the definition of “small city” and “big city” is quite different in China.  If you desire to be placed in a city with a specific population, please make it known in your preliminary application.</p>
<p>We will do all we can to place you in the city size you desire, but we cannot guarantee this.</p></blockquote>
<p>[/expand]</p>
<p>[expand title=&#8221;When can I submit my application? How long before the semester begins?&#8221; tag=&#8221;h3&#8243;]</p>
<blockquote><p>You may submit your application as far in advance as you would like.</p>
<p>If you have decided to go to China, filled out a preliminary application, and participated in the phone interview, then there is no reason to delay applying.</p>
<p>What you don’t want to do is wait until 11:59 the night before the application deadline is due to submit it.  If you are ready to apply, do it.</p></blockquote>
<p>[/expand]</p>
<p>[expand title=&#8221;Are married couples welcome to apply together?&#8221; tag=&#8221;h3&#8243;]</p>
<blockquote><p>Yes.</p>
<p>Married couples receive a program fee discount.</p>
<p>Married couples will be placed in the same apartment and the same school. However, couples are not guaranteed to have the exact same teaching schedules.</p></blockquote>

<p>[expand title=&#8221;What is the difference between public and private schools?&#8221; tag=&#8221;h3&#8243;]</p>
<blockquote><p>Students attending public schools tend to possess a higher English level and are better behaved because of their desire to succeed and improve their lifestyle.</p>
<p>It is not uncommon for students from private schools to come from financially well-off families.  Though the students want to learn, they are at times easily distracted and need a bit more encouragement and motivation to learn English.</p>
<p>The trade-off is the size of each class. Public school classes may include as many as 50-70 students while private schools typically have no more than 25-30 students in a classroom.  Your ability to learn everyone&#8217;s name is definitely put to the challenge in public schools more so than in private schools.</p></blockquote>

<p>[expand title=&#8221;What if I&#8217;m not an English or Education major?&#8221; tag=&#8221;h3&#8243;]</p>
<blockquote><p>The teaching position focuses extensively on conversational language training.  You must  come up with conversational activities and lessons that help students use the English they already know, along with what they are currently learning from their Chinese English teachers.</p>
<p>You are not required to teach a lot of grammar or other rules.  The students will often have no idea what you are saying, but you must still immerse them in English and help them  feel more comfortable hearing it from a fluent English speaker.</p></blockquote>

During the mean time, if you need to contact your family, the school will provide you access to the internet through the school or a nearby internet café.</p>
<p>Phone cards should be reliable and easy to use.</p>
<p>Some means of communicating can be fickle depending on current internet restrictions. For instance, Facebook and various blog websites such as Blogger are regularly blocked. However, email and instant messaging programs are rarely blocked.</p></blockquote>

<p>You will want to make sure you become very acquainted with the phrase:</p>
<p>“Do you have vegetarian food?”</p>
<p>Print off the characters for that phrase to show restaurants. You will most likely want to learn how to say it correctly too.</p>
<p>There are other phrases that might be useful to learn, such as “Is there a vegetarian restaurant nearby? Is this cooked with animal broth?”  You can find these phrases easily online by searching on Google.</p>
<p>Purchasing a Mandarin Chinese phrasebook might be useful as well. Most phrasebooks will have a few pages on how to order vegetarian meals.</p></blockquote>

<p>[expand title=&#8221;Is food a big part of Chinese Culture?&#8221; tag=&#8221;h3&#8243;]</p>
<blockquote><p>Yes.</p>
<p>Food is the center Chinese life. Sharing meals together is very important among friends and families. Your school will likely invite you to important dinners and banquets. You are an important guest and will be expected to attend important events your school asks you to attend (when you are able to).</p>
<p>Because food is so important in China, you need to be respectful. Observing the people around you will help you know how to act during meals.  Over time, you will learn proper Chinese manners.</p>
<p>The Chinese are very understanding to the fact that you are foreign. They are very respectful and nonjudgmental while you are learning proper eating etiquette.</p></blockquote>

<p>A great deal of Chinese food in America is similar to Hong Kong (Cantonese) food. Over the years, it has been transformed to better satisfy American taste buds.</p>
<p>The ideas behind Chinese food are the same. Most of the main ingredients are the same, but the spices and additional ingredients are different.</p>
<p>It is not impossible to find authentic Chinese food in America, but your typical fast food Chinese tastes very different than authentic Chinese food.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Alcohol is a large part of the food culture in China. It is more common for women not to drink then men.</p>
<p>When you are invited to eat, your host will most likely offer some kind of alcohol. As their guest, they will feel it is their host duty to buy you alcohol for your meals.</p>
<p>It is fine and perfectly acceptable to politely refuse any alcoholic drinks.</p>
<p>Most of the time you can just say, “I do not drink (beer, wine, alcohol)” and that will be the end of it. Sometimes you need to be a little more creative and explain why you don’t drink.</p>
<p>If you do not drink because of a religious belief, you can say, “I do not drink (beer, wine, alcohol) because of my religious beliefs.”  You should, however, leave it at that. Government regulations do not allow for you to go into details as to why your religious beliefs influence you not to drink alcohol. A very effective way to turn down an offer is to say, &#8220;I do not drink (beer, wine, alcohol) because of my family tradition.&#8221; Family and tradition are both things Chinese people relate very well to.</p>
<p>Most of the time, your host and friends will be very respectful of your decision to not drink. There will, on occasion, be a time when your host or friend think you are just trying to be polite. In that case, they will continue to offer it to you a few times. You must understand they are not trying to be rude or pushy; this is just part of their cultural upbringing.</p></blockquote>

<p>You are welcomed to stay as long as you would like, until your visa expires. China Horizons will help to coordinate and change your air departure date.</p>

<p>If you desire to see these places, you can make arrangements to do so during vacation times, weekends, or after the semester ends.</p>
<p>China is very well connected through rail lines and airlines, and if a teacher dedicates themselves to going to a few of these places, they will most likely be able to.</p></blockquote>
